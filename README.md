Instructions for how to execute the code is specified in the docstring at the start of the script. Essentially, 
all the data that is required will require user input in response to questions asked by the script. Acceptable answers

The Huckel_Energies.csv file is an example output file of the program. It contains the Huckel energies and degeneracies for 
the dodecahedral case.
