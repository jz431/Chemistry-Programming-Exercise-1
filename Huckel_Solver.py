"""General Huckel Solver.

For an arbritary linear, cyclic or a sp2 Platonic polyene consisting of a 
carbon skeleton with n atoms, this script will generate for the Ï€-system the 
Huckel energies and their associated degeneracies. The octahedral shape is also
supported. It also runs a basic check that the energies are correct by summing 
the Huckel energies together, which should equal 0. The energies and 
degeneracies are directly printed as well as saved in a .csv file.

This script requires the import of the "numpy", "decimal", "csv" and "sys"
modules.

The program will require user input at various stages. 
To determine the kind of molecule you wish to calculate the energies for, 
please type "linear" for a linear molecule, "cyclic" for a cyclic molecule or 
"Platonic solid" for a sp2 hybridized Platonic solid (capitalization does 
not matter) when prompted.

To determine the number of carbons in your linear or cyclic system, please 
type an integer number when prompted. 

To choose the kind of Platonic solid you wish to solve, please type 
"tetrahedron" for a tetrahedron, "cube" for a cube, "octahedron" for an 
octahedron and "dodecahedron" for a dodecahedron when prompted.
